#+TITLE: Reproducing the Rustic fmt bug

1. Open =lib.rs=.
2. Make some trivial change and save the buffer.
3. Notice that auto-formatting works.
4. Uncomment the ~bar~ function.
5. Save, and notice a popup that complains incorrectly about having the wrong
   version of Rust configured (it's unhappy about the ~async~ keyword).
